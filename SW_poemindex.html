<h1 style="text-align:center">The Tree Of Song</h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center">By Sara Teasdale</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">I sang my songs for the rest,<br/>
For you I am still;<br/>
The tree of my song is bare<br/>
On its shinning hill.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">For you came like a lordly wing,<br/>
And the leaves were whirled<br/>
Far as forgotten things<br/>
Past the rim of the world.</p>

<p style="text-align:center">The tree of my song stands bare<br/>
Against the blue,<br/>
I gave my song to the rest,<br/>
Myself to you.</p>
